/*Given a number N, to find all the prime factors of it. 
Example:
Input: 12   Output: 2 2 3
Input: 100  Output: 2 2 5 5
Input: 315  Output: 3 3 5 7

Logic:
If we start dividing the number by the smallest possible prime number (2) then all of its 
multiples or composite numbers will automatically be removed before we actually reach that number.

Example: We can divide 12 by 2 two times and remove that factors from 12 to get 3 
thus making sure that composite number 4 (multiple of 2) does not occur at any later point of time.
